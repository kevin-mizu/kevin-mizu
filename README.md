## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as a Pentester at a French company and spend a lot of my free time on Web Security Research (I'm part of the [@ctbbpodcast](https://x.com/ctbbpodcast) research lab).
I play CTFs mainly with two teams: [@FlatNetworkOrg](https://x.com/FlatNetworkOrg) and [@Rhackgondins](https://x.com/Rhackgondins) ðŸ¦¦

*I was also a member of the [@ECSC_TeamFrance](https://x.com/ECSC_TeamFrance) in 2023 ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.*

I try to share as much as I can about what I learn on my blog (https://mizu.re/), covering CTF writeups, research projects, and more.

## Conferences

I'm made several conferences for student (ESNA, ESAIP), as well as at other events such as:

## Projects

I also love coding, mostly in javascript and python. My favorite and main project is [DOMLogger++](https://github.com/kevin-mizu/domloggerpp) which aims to automate the detection of client-side web vulnerabilty (it could has well be used by devs to debbug their app :D).
